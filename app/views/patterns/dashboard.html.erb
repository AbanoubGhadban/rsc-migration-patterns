<h1>Pattern 4: Async Server Components with Suspense</h1>
<p>
  Each dashboard section is an independent <strong>async Server Component</strong> wrapped in
  <code>&lt;Suspense&gt;</code>. They stream progressively as their data fetches complete.
</p>

<%= stream_react_component('Dashboard', props: @dashboard_props, prerender: true) %>
